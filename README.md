Developed a custom timeline application using Python that manages chronological events through a doubly-linked list data structure. Implemented core functionality including dynamic event insertion, targeted removal with bidirectional search, and in-place sorting algorithms. Designed with OOP principles featuring encapsulated Timeline and Event classes with proper pointer management for maintaining list integrity across all operations.
